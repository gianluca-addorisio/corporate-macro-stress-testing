# Corporate Macro Stress Testing

This project develops a quantitative framework to assess how
macroeconomic shocks translate into financial stress at the firm level.

The focus is on margins, cash flows, and financial sustainability
under adverse macroeconomic scenarios.

---

## Motivation
Firms are exposed to macroeconomic risk, yet stress testing practices
are often qualitative or loosely structured.
This project provides a transparent and replicable approach
to link macroeconomic scenarios to corporate financial outcomes.

---

## Research Questions
- How do macroeconomic shocks affect key corporate financial variables?
- Which balance-sheet components are most vulnerable under stress?
- Under which scenarios does financial sustainability become critical?

---

## Methodology
- Macroeconomic scenarios (GDP growth, inflation, interest rates)
- Transmission to firm-level financial variables via elasticities
- Scenario-based simulations
- Risk metrics on margins and cash flows

---

## Applications
- Corporate risk assessment
- Financial planning under stress
- Decision support for investment and risk management

---

## Tools
Python, basic econometrics, scenario analysis

## Disclaimer
This project uses stylized assumptions and public data
for illustrative and educational purposes.
